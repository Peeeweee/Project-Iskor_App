# 🏀 Project: Iskor-App

The Iskor App is a simple and user-friendly sports scoring tool designed for everyone — from event organizers to casual players. It lets anyone manually score their games while following the official rules for each sport.

## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration behind **Iskor-App** came from **Peeeweee**, who wanted a practical scoreboard for casual noontime or free-time basketball, soccer, and volleyball games. While playing with friends, I noticed how inconvenient it was to remember scores mid-game, especially since there were no referees during these friendly matches. This need for a simple yet reliable scoreboard inspired the creation of Iskor-App — a tool designed to make casual sports more organized and enjoyable.

Anyone can use this software for **manual scoring** during games, as it follows rule-based logic for each supported sport — ensuring fairness and consistency even in informal matches.

We’re also **open to suggestions** from users who want to contribute ideas or features that could improve the app further.
