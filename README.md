## üí° Inspiration

The inspiration behind **Iskor-App** came from **Peeeweee**, who wanted a practical scoreboard for casual noontime or free-time basketball, soccer, and volleyball games. While playing with friends, I noticed how inconvenient it was to remember scores mid-game, especially since there were no referees during these friendly matches. This need for a simple yet reliable scoreboard inspired the creation of Iskor-App ‚Äî a tool designed to make casual sports more organized and enjoyable.

Anyone can use this software for **manual scoring** during games, as it follows rule-based logic for each supported sport ‚Äî ensuring fairness and consistency even in informal matches.

We‚Äôre also **open to suggestions** from users who want to contribute ideas or features that could improve the app further.
