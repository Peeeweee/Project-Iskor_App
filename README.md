## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration came from **Peeeweee**, who wanted a practical, no-fuss scoreboard for casual basketball, soccer, and volleyball games. Many players forget scores during friendly matches without referees — so **Iskor-App** was created to solve that problem. It’s a simple yet reliable solution for bringing structure and fairness to informal sports sessions.
